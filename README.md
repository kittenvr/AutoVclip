# AutoVclip Addon for the Meteor Client.

<h2>How to use:</h2>

* Use the command ".avclip up/down" or ".avc up/down" to automatically vclip up or down.

<i>(You can also bind the ".avclip up" and ".avclip down" commands, by creating a macro within the Meteor Client).</i>

<h2>What makes AutoVclip different from AutoClipAddon?</h2>

- **AutoVclip** changes the way the player is being teleported, to a more efficient and non-clunky one. Instead of teleporting to the position of the closest block, it now teleports the player to the height of the block, thus reducing clunkiness.

- **AutoVclip** actually vclips the player up. It checks if the next 10 blocks upwards are AIR and if one of them isn't, it teleports the player above it. You do not need to stick your head directly under a block to clip through.

- **AutoVclip** works with boats and other rideable entities too!
